## FAQ

**When should we introduce a learning tower to our toddler?**
Most children benefit from learning towers around 18 months when they show interest in kitchen activities and can stand steadily, though some families start as early as 12 months with close supervision. Look for signs like pulling up on furniture, wanting to see counter activities, and showing frustration about being excluded from kitchen tasks.

**How do Montessori furniture principles benefit child development beyond aesthetics?**
Child-height accessibility promotes independence by letting kids access books, toys, and activities without adult help, building confidence and problem-solving skills. Low floor beds allow children to get in and out independently, respecting their autonomy while maintaining safety through low fall heights. These design choices support self-directed learning central to Montessori philosophy.

**Is investing in expensive kids furniture worth it when children outgrow things quickly?**
Quality adjustable furniture like learning towers with multiple height settings and convertible beds adapting from toddler through teen years provide longer use than fixed-size alternatives. Heirloom construction quality means furniture survives multiple children or resale rather than breaking and requiring replacement. The per-year cost often becomes lower than repeatedly buying cheap furniture.
